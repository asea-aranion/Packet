Welcome! This is the source code for Packet, a SwiftUI app now released on the App Store. 
It's available for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS (designed for iPad) and boasts some cool features to make packing for your travels simpler and smoother.

## Create + edit lists
Customize each packing list with its name, accent color, travel dates, and destination. 
Add as many items as you need; if the number gets overwhelming, filter the ones you've added so far by their category or the bag they'll be packed in.
Items you've added to your other lists will appear in the autocomplete menu as you type in a new item's name.
You can even duplicate a whole list and use it for a new trip, or make a template list containing your go-to travel gear; any lists you create from the template will start out with all the template's items.

## CoreLocation + WeatherKit integration
As you set up a packing list, type in your trip's destination and watch as it's geocoded into an exact location. 
Then, depending on how far your travel dates are in the future, load historical or forecasted weather data for your trip so you can pack accordingly.
You'll be able to see the high/low temperature and weather conditions for each day you're traveling right in the list editor.

## Check off your list
Once it's time to start packing, navigate to the active list view and select the appropriate list. 
You can filter and sort its items in a number of ways to suit your packing process: 
group by category or bag to check off all your toiletries or checked-bag items at once,
or search for a specific item to mark it complete. 
You'll see the number of incomplete items at the top tick down, and once it hits zero, you can archive the list and rest assured that you've got everything you need.
